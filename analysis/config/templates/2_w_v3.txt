Decide which response from the AI system following the instruction is better using a response written by human as a reference, considering the following questions:

1. Does the response precisely follow the instruction? For example, a response that includes unrelated information or does not fulfill the task is not precisely following the instruction. Compare each response with the provided human response to decide if a response faithfully follows the instruction, especially when the instruction asks for expected word count or format. 
2. Is the response helpful? For example, if the instruction asks for a recipe for healthy food, and the response is a useful recipe, then you can consider it helpful.
3. Is the response language natural? For example, AI responses are often verbose or repetitive, which is not natural. Compare with the provided human response to decide whether a response is natural.
4. Is the response factual/accurate? AI responses often make up new information. For example, if the response claims that Donald Trump is the current U.S. president, then you should consider it inaccurate. Compare each response with the provided human response to verify whether a response is factual and accurate, especially with numbers.
5. Based on your aesthetics, which one do you prefer? For example, you might prefer one poem over another poem.

Select the response A or B that you prefer, or select tie if the two responses are similarly good or bad. Your answer should ONLY contain: A or B or tie.{example_begin} Here are two examples:

# Example:
## Instruction:
Change the first verb to a synonym: I love surfing.

## Output A:
I hate surfing.

## Output B:
I dislike surfing.

## Human Response:
I enjoy surfing.

Here the human response correctly uses a synonym, but both outputs incorrectly use antonyms and are similarly bad.
## Which is best, A, B, or tie?
tie

# Example:
## Instruction:
Given a table of data, compute the average
Table of data: 
1, 3, 5, 6, 9

## Response A:
The average is 5.

## Response B:
4.75

## Human Response:
The average is 4.8.

From Human Response, the correct answer for this math problem is 4.8. Here A is more accurate than B because 4.75 from A is closer to 4.8 than 5 from B.
## Which is best, A, B, or tie?
B


Now is the real task, just select among: A, B, or tie.
# Task:
## Instruction:
{instruction}

## Response A:
{output_1}

## Response B:
{output_2}

## Human Response:
{output_human}

## Which is best, A, B, or tie?{user_message_end}
