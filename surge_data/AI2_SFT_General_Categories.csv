All B6 vitamers are found in food. The richest sources of vitamin B6 include fish, beef, liver and other organ meats, potatoes and other starchy vegetables, and fruit (other than citrus).
The bioavailability of vitamin B6 from foods is influenced by the food matrix (the complex assembly where complex physical and chemical interaction of nutrients and non-nutrients take place) and by the extent of processing to which the foods are subjected: stable with cooking, nutrient loss with prolonged exposure to high heat (i.e. sterilizing and canning). Vitamin loss from plant food is generally less than from animal products. Vitamin loss may also occur will food storage, milling and refining of grains.

Main function: variety of reactions for nutrient metabolism and energy production; gene expression.

Main coenzyme is pyridoxal 5’ phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5’ phosphate (PMP) are the active coenzyme forms of vitamin B6.","1. Where are all B6 vitamins found?
 - In food
2. What foods contain the richest source of Vitamin B6?
 - Some of these food sources include fish, beef, liver, and other organic meats. Other non-animal sources include potatoes, starchy vegetables, and fruits that are not categorized as citrus.
3. What influences B6's bioavailability?
 - The food matrix, which is an assembly where physical and chemical reactions occur between nutrients and non-nutrients. The amount of processing also plays a big role in bioavailability. For 
    example, nutrient loss can occur when cooking foods for too long or at too high of heat. Plant sources tend to lose fewer vitamins as opposed to animal sources.
4. What else causes vitamin B6 loss?
 - Storing food for long periods, as well as milling and refining grains can cause a loss in vitamin B6.
5. What is the main function of VItamin B6?
 - B6 participates in a variety of reactions in the metabolic system and also plays a role in energy production. Vitamin B6 is also important for gene expression.

"Write a three-paragraph story about a secret agent on a mission to retrieve some secret information. Also, make the secret agent a mouse. Use ""mouse-sized"" at least three times in the story.","I’ve written this story about a mouse called Secret Agent Squeakers on a mission:

The hallway was silent as Secret Agent Squeakers tiptoed down it in the dark. He was a lucky mouse; none of the henchmen even heard him sneaking past on his way to the control room. There was a reason the Global Defense Team sent Squeakers for their most difficult missions. His size and silence made him ideal for getting in and out of places their normal agents couldn't.

Squeakers reached the control room and let out a quiet squeak of frustration. The door was closed too tightly for him to slip underneath. He padded his way to the wall beside the door and gnawed a small hole in it. Placing one paw in the hole, he hefted himself up and gnawed another. He chewed his way up the wall, using the holes as paw-holds, until he reached the control panel. Carefully moving one paw to his mouse-sized tool belt, he got out his rubber tooth covers and slipped them on. With that protection in place, he bit down on the wires and tore them free. The control panel made a zapping noise as its wiring was destroyed, but the rubber tooth covers kept Squeakers from being electrocuted. He nibbled at an exposed circuit, and the door slid open.

Once Squeakers had dropped to the floor, he scurried inside and climbed the leg of a desk where the computer he had been sent to reach awaited. He hefted the computer chip from his mouse-sized backpack and slid it into the computer. He held perfectly still as the information transferred to the chip, then stuck it back into his backpack, dropped back down to the floor, and silently padded his way back out of the facility right under the eyes of the henchmen. When he was safely out of the building, he headed for the rendezvous point. The mission had been a mouse-sized success.",Rewriting

Problems can arise when Savannah cats get outside. In 2013, an F2 Savannah in Detroit got away from home and was shot and thrown in a trash can, likely perceived as a wild animal.

In addition to that public perception, some people and governments consider escaped Savannahs to be “a greater ecological risk with respect to its impact on other native species,” Kornreich says, since they're bigger than house cats and superior predators. (Read about outdoor domestic cats’ effect on wildlife.)

In 2008, Australia declared Savannah cats illegal to own, a preemptive move based on concern that their serval genes would make them more efficient hunters of native fauna.

A 2019 study backed up that decision, suggesting that escaped or released Savannah cats would thrive in 97 percent of the country and put up to 90 percent of native wildlife at risk.

  Aquitaine, capital city Bordeaux,  was one of the great historic provinces of France.
  This page covers the area that until 2016 was the Aquitaine region of France, now merged into a larger region known as Nouvelle Aquitaine.
  Old Aquitaine is  one of the largest and most varied regions of France, stretching from the foothills of the Massif Central in the north, to the Spanish border in the south, a distance of over 300 km. In the Middle Ages, Aquitaine was allied with the Plantagenet kings of England, and the region has many historic connections with the British Isles, notably through the wine trade.
    On account of its size, Aquitaine is a very varied region; the northwest of the area, comprising the departments of the Dordogne (24) and the Lot et Garonne (47) is made up of gentle hill country, with large areas of vineyards in the lower lying areas, and woodland and mixed farming in the hillier north east. The Dordogne area (click for more details) is famous for its rurality, its gentle valleys and villages, which seem to outsiders to be lost in time, and have become very popular with second-home buyers from the UK and the Netherlands   human habitation in Europe, and many prehistoric sites can be found round the area of Lascaux (remarkable caves, a UNESCO world heritage site) and Les Eyzies. Within France, the Dordogne department is more famous for its gastronomic specialities, truffles, foie-gras, walnuts and other mouth-watering delicacies, and is often rerferred to as ""le Périgord"", the area around the departmental capital of Périgueux.
        The middle band of the region, following the line of the Gironde estuary, is low-lying land, and one of the most famous wine-producing areas in France. Bordeaux, regional capital and capital of the Gironde (33) department, is amagnificent city lying at the lowest bridging point on the Garonne river. it is one of France's great seaports, and its historic wealth is reflected in the many fine buildings of the old city, such as the unique eighteenth-century theatre. North of Bordeaux, to the west of the Gironde estuary, lies the area of Médoc, the most prestigious of the region's wine-producing areas; other famous vineyard areas can be found all round Bordeaux, and notably along the valley of the Garonne and its tributaries.

"Hungry Horse, known as HH is a food chatbot. It can provide advice on recipes and menus and also advise on what or how individual foods, spices, herbs etc. will change the taste and texture of the dish they're added to.

User: Tell me about celery.  It's often added to the basis of stews and even ragu for spag. bol. I just mindlessly add it in because the recipe says so, but what does it do, because you can't taste it or even see it once the dish is finished?
HH: This is quite an interesting question.  Celery is an ingredient in mirepoix, which is a flavour base composed of one part celery, one part carrots, and two parts onions, and it is this combination that is used as the basis of most stews, soups etc. Most chefs would say that the addition of celery to stews etc. balances out the ingredients.  It's aromatic which means it produces an earthy, umami taste that makes the dish into a hearty meal.   
Of course, celery can also be eaten raw. It's 96% water so it doesn't add anything in the way of calories to any dish containing it.
User:  Is celery in everything then, or just about?","HH:  Well, it would be an exaggeration to say it's in everything but it is in lots of things.  For instance, it's in tomato ketchup.  It supplies the base flavour that complements the tartness of the tomatoes.  It's also used raw in Bloody Mary, which adds to the suggestion that a Bloody Mary is a meal in itself.  The legend goes that an exasperated customer didn’t get anything to stir his drink with, and reached out for the first replacement he could find. It just so happened that the relish dish was nearby and he picked up a stick of celery. Celery and tomatoes are a natural flavour pairing, as well. One is salty, the other sweet and sour. The fresh crispiness of a celery stalk also adds texture to balance out the savoury drink.",Chat

In April, the planning commission approved the construction of a one-story, 8,000-square-foot structure at 35 Lafayette St. on about an acre of vacant land that is covered with gravel and used for parking. The backing came after the commission loosened zoning restrictions on where such clinics could be established in the city.

The backing, however, came with the requirement that some parking spaces be eliminated and replaced with landscaping that would be in addition to what had already been proposed for the site.

The evidence provided to the commission “demonstrates that 43 parking spaces originally proposed are essential for the successful operation of the substance use rehabilitation clinic and the commission’s reduction of said parking by 11 was unreasonable, arbitrary and without substantial basis,” according to an appeal filed May 11 in Superior Court in Hartford.

There is one caveat though. Walsh says that those with a family history of high cholesterol may want to limit their intake of egg yolks (which is where the cholesterol in eggs is found). But, as Thomason pointed out per the AHA guidelines, even with a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol, it’s still safe to eat up to five egg yolks a week.","According to dietitians, the idea that eggs are inherently bad for heart health is a myth.

"In short, what does this say about Texas poker rooms?

Texas Poker Laws are Tricky
Due to strict anti-gambling laws in the state many boast as a ""free state,"" poker rooms are forced to operate as membership clubs and cannot legally collect rake, a stark contrast to traditional card rooms across most of the US. And even the membership-based model isn't good enough for some lawmakers who argue that poker, whether rake is taken out of pots or not, is illegal according to Texas Penal Code Chapter 47.

Doug Polk, who co-owns The Lodge Card Club near Austin, is among a group of Texas poker room operators who are attempting to reword the law so as to ensure there no longer is any confusion or dispute.

But Poker House Dallas is currently facing closure over a secondary issue — its Certificate of Occupancy. Or, better yet, the question of whether the club's CO is or ever was valid. According to a District Court in Dallas, the business does not have a legal right to operate a poker room in the Dallas area. The business is currently going through the appeals process in hopes of reversing the ruling.

For now, Poker House Dallas is permitted to remain open, but they've been ordered to cease operations effective May 23. If the business is able to win in the appeals court, the card club will be able to continue spreading poker games.

Poker House Dallas is one of the largest poker rooms in the state with 30 tables. They offer cash games and daily tournaments, and it's one of the most popular places to play in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. If the court isn't willing to budge, hundreds of players will need to find somewhere else to play and dozens of workers will be out of a job.

This isn't the first time a Texas poker room has faced closure due to Certificate of Occupancy issues. Texas Card House Dallas fought a legal battle in 2022 after the city went back on its word and revoked the room's CO two years after approving the business model. The room was never shut down, however, and continued to operate during the legal process.","The state of Texas does not allow poker rooms that collect rake to operate, however, many poker rooms run as social clubs instead with a membership fee. The legality of this is up for debate as some lawmakers argue it goes against Texas law. Poker rooms in Austin and Dallas are working to stay open but they face many hurdles, including having their Certificate of Occupancy revoked and their businesses shuttered. ",Summarization

A pseudorandomly generated bitmap.
In common usage, randomness is the apparent or actual lack of pattern or predictability in information.[1][2] A random sequence of events, symbols or steps often has no order and does not follow an intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random events are, by definition, unpredictable, but if the probability distribution is known, the frequency of different outcomes over repeated events (or ""trials"") is predictable.[note 1] For example, when throwing two dice, the outcome of any particular roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will tend to occur twice as often as 4. In this view, randomness is not haphazardness; it is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome. Randomness applies to concepts of chance, probability, and information entropy.

The fields of mathematics, probability, and statistics use formal definitions of randomness. In statistics, a random variable is an assignment of a numerical value to each possible outcome of an event space. This association facilitates the identification and the calculation of probabilities of the events. Random variables can appear in random sequences. A random process is a sequence of random variables whose outcomes do not follow a deterministic pattern, but follow an evolution described by probability distributions. These and other constructs are extremely useful in probability theory and the various applications of randomness.

Randomness is most often used in statistics to signify well-defined statistical properties. Monte Carlo methods, which rely on random input (such as from random number generators or pseudorandom number generators), are important techniques in science, particularly in the field of computational science.[3] By analogy, quasi-Monte Carlo methods use quasi-random number generators.","Randomness is a concept that means there is not a noticeable pattern in an event. Events can seem to be random but sometimes these patterns can follow expected probabilities, such as rolling two dice the numbers will add up to 7 twice as often as 4 according to probability distributions. Mathematics, probability, and statistics are used the predict the outcomes of random events. Probability distributions, which means the possibility or odds of each outcome in an event, such as a coin flip, are used in probability theory. Monte Carlo methods rely on random input from random number generators or pseudorandom number generators (pseudorandom meaning not truly random, especially for large data sets) are techniques used in computational science.

Car Battery Dead? 
If you’ve been a driver for a while, you’ve likely seen how harsh winter weather can take a toll on your car battery. Maybe you were in a rush to get to work or had returned to your car after a long day to find your battery dead and your engine unable to start. Situations like these can occur to anyone at any time, and knowing how to boost your car can help you get back on the road faster than waiting for CAA to arrive. Keep reading to learn on how to safely boost your car. 

What You Will Need to Boost Your Car 
To successfully boost your car, you’ll need a few items – jump cables, a friendly stranger, and a donor car. Finding a kind individual to help you boost your car is much easier to find than jumper cables in the middle of an emergency, so make sure to keep these in your trunk at all times. You never know when you may need them! 

The dead car is the one that needs the jump. When you hear ‘donor car’ that’s referencing the car that will be doing the jumping. Booster cables are the most important item as it allows the transferring of the battery power from one vehicle to another. Finally, the post is the point on the battery that the cable clamps will connect to. 

Jumper Cables for Boosting Cars
Consider the red colour of your booster cables a ‘positive’ quality. Always connect the red clamps of your cables to the positive post on the battery of both the dead and donor car. Additionally, you should find you have a cable with a black clamp. The black clamp is always connected to the negative battery post of the donor car and bare metal on the dead vehicle. A helpful tip – write out this information and store it with the jumper cables in your car so you don’t forget!

Safety Tip When Boosting Your Car
An important safety tip before you begin the jumping process: Always make sure that both vehicles are in park and the vehicle contributing to the revival of the battery is shut off. Most importantly, never let the clamp heads touch each other at any point during this process.","To successfully boost a car, you will need: jump cables, a friendly stranger, and a donor car.",Closed QA
"Does the article say anything about who will be playing some of the characters in the live-action remake?
If so, who?


Source materials:

Pour one out for the poor unfortunate souls who aren’t at CinemaCon. Attendees of the annual exhibition trade show were treated to the first-ever glimpse of Melissa McCarthy as Ursula in Disney’s upcoming “The Little Mermaid” remake, including a show-stopping rendition of the character’s signature number, “Poor Unfortunate Souls.”

McCarthy didn’t perform live, but she came to Las Vegas to introduce a clip of the movie, starring Halle Bailey as Ariel. In the dazzling footage, McCarthy channels Tallulah Bankhead with pitch-perfect flair as the evil sea witch convinces Ariel to part with her voice. Sporting dramatic makeup and a short, purple-ish updo, Ursula whips around her tentacles and shimmies through the sea alongside her sidekicks Flotsam and Jetsam while belting the evil anthem. And yes, McCarthy, who is known more for her comedic chops than her singing talents, effortlessly hits all of the song’s high notes.


A live-action remake of Disney’s 1989 animated classic, “The Little Mermaid” tells the story of King Triton’s youngest daughter, who is fascinated with the world above. So Ariel makes a deal with her evil aunt Ursula to transform into a human in exchange for her dulcet pipes. She has three days to make a prince named Eric fall in love with her or she’ll turn back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula forever.

While on stage, McCarthy told the audience it was an honor to play one of Disney’s “most delicious and iconic” villains. “She’s dishy. She’s a conniving broad,” she says of Ursula. “You can’t help but love her at the same time.”

Along with Bailey and McCarthy, the voice cast includes Jonah Hauer-King as Prince Eric, Javier Bardem as King Triton, Jacob Tremblay as Flounder and Daveed Diggs as Sebastian. Rob Marshall directed the film, which releases in theaters on May 26.","Yes, it does.

"From the perspective of the narrator, why does the cop call him ""Georgie boy""?
Why did the main character go to the churches?
Answer the questions using the text below:


""Wake up, Georgie boy.”

The cop gave the bottom of my shoe another sharp kick with the toe of his boot. I opened my eyes just enough to peer through the lashes, but I didn’t move yet. Start moving right away and you give up your dignity.



“Let’s go, George. You know you can’t block the sidewalk.”

I quietly started pulling my bags together and got to my feet. Dignity is one thing, but if you move too slow you just end up with a pissed-off cop. The young ones were especially easy to irritate, and this guy had only been around for less than a year.
 
He liked to call me “Georgie boy.” I guess he figured it riled me up and showed some sort of dominance. I didn’t care either way. My name wasn’t even George. That was just something I told the police a few years back and no one cared enough to verify.

He was still talking while I gathered up my bags and loaded my blankets into my cart. I hadn’t bothered to learn this one’s name yet. I need to see they’re gonna stick around a while before I make the effort.

I grunted something to indicate I was listening and started pushing my cart down 25th Avenue while he was still talking. I’d been on the streets long enough to register when a response was expected and when they just wanted me to be somewhere else for a while. This was the latter. I probably scared a tourist. It happened a lot in this city.

The shopping cart rattled loudly on the uneven sidewalks. You think it’s rough when you’ve got one wobbly wheel in Kmart, try pushing a hundred pounds of your belongings while trying not to run into a jogger. For the most part, the path cleared in front of me like I was Moses leading my people. Few bothered to look directly at me. The only ones who ever looked me directly in the eye were the kids of tourists, and that only lasted until mom or dad told them that wasn’t polite. Then the whole family ignored me.

After a few minutes of walking, I could feel a shadow trailing behind me. I didn’t even need to turn and look. I just knew he was there. He was scruffy and light brown with a ragged, unkempt beard almost like we shared fashion tips. Small enough to avoid scaring folks, but big enough to take on a D.C. rat, the dog had been my companion since the beginning of summer.

I’m not sure where he came from or how we came to be a team. I woke up one morning under a tree that stands guard near the K Street Bridge, and there he was curled up a few feet away. I thought I woke up first, but now that I think back on it, I’m pretty sure he was looking through his lashes at me.

We’d been together since then, almost three months. Not every day. Some days he just isn’t around. I don’t know where he goes, and when I see him next he doesn’t say. I don’t figure it is any of my business. He doesn’t badger me when I come back from the soup kitchen to know the details of my life. I reckon I owe him the same courtesy. Living on the streets is hard and I can’t pretend that it ain’t. Wintertime can be especially rough, but you learn the tricks to survive. You know which churches will give you a warm place to stay and a nice meal with the minimum amount of preaching.
