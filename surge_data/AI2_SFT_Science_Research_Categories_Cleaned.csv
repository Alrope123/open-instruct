"Based on the evidence, what was the most common type of disc prolapse? List the categories of prolapse with their percentages of incidence from greatest to smallest.

In our institution we operated 584 patients of degenerative disc diseases from July 1998–December 2006. There were 541 patients of lumbar prolapsed discs. Of these 541 discs, 50 cases (11%) were of the classical CES. There were 33 males and 17 females with average age of 48 years, ranging from 25 to 85 years. All patients had classical features of CES. The delay in surgery from the onset of the perianal anesthesia and disturbances in micturition (which was arbitrarily considered as a starting point of CES) ranged from 1 to 35 days and the mean was 12.2 days. Detailed clinical examination was done at presentation and clinical findings were recorded. Anal wink was present in 44 patients and absent in the rest of the 6 cases. Bilateral saddle anesthesia was present in 45 patients and absent in rest of the 5 patients. Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (Fig. 1) was done in all patients to quantify the extent of prolapse and also the type (posterocentral/posterolateral). Out of the 50 cases, 22(44%) had L4-5 prolapsed inter-vertebral disc (PIVD), 10(20%) had L5-S1 PIVD, 10(20%) had multilevel PIVD (most common combination being L4-5, L5-S1), 4(8%) had L3-4 PIVD and 4(8%) had L2-3 PIVD. All patients underwent wide laminectomy and discectomy (Fig. 2a, b). No fixation or fusion was done in any case except two cases of multilevel PIVD where instrumentation had to be done to prevent instability. The patients were followed every fortnightly for the first 3 months and every month there after. During each follow-up a detailed neurological examination was performed and recorded.'","L4-5 prolapsed inter-vertebral disc was the most common type of disc prolapse in this study.

The categories of prolapse were as follows, from the most number to the least:

- L4-5 prolapsed inter-vertebral disc (PIVD) - 44%
- L5-S1 PIVD - 20%
- Multilevel PIVD (most common combination being L4-5, L5-S1) - 10%

"How far can the claim be supported by the evidence given? Refer to the text in your answer.

Claim: Snapchat and Instagram are the way forward when it comes to social media. 

Evidence: 'With the exception of YouTube and Reddit, most platforms show little growth since 2019
YouTube is the most commonly used online platform asked about in this survey, and there’s evidence that its reach is growing. Fully 81% of Americans say they ever use the video-sharing site, up from 73% in 2019. Reddit was the only other platform polled about that experienced statistically significant growth during this time period – increasing from 11% in 2019 to 18% today. 

Facebook’s growth has leveled off over the last five years, but it remains one of the most widely used social media sites among adults in the United States: 69% of adults today say they ever use the site, equaling the share who said this two years prior.  

Similarly, the respective shares of Americans who report using Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Twitter and WhatsApp are statistically unchanged since 2019. This represents a broader trend that extends beyond the past two years in which the rapid adoption of most of these sites and apps seen in the last decade has slowed. (This was the first year the Center asked about TikTok via a phone poll and the first time it has surveyed about Nextdoor.)'","This claim is difficult to support using the evidence given. The main issue is that the evidence doesn't offer any projections about what may happen in the future in terms of the use of these social media platforms and the claim does not specify what is meant by 'the way forward.' Added to this, the trends shown by the data would imply that both Snapchat and Instagram are not currently growing as platforms since the number of Americans who report using them has remained 'statistically unchanged since 2019,' unlike YouTube and Reddit, which both show growth since 2019. In turn, this would imply that Snapchat and Instagram may not be platforms that will garner increasing interest and engagement in the future, which casts doubt over the claim that they are 'the way forward.'",Fact Checking / Attributed QA

"Based on research on the history of the wolf, when do they believe the grey wolf first appeared?

The Evolutionary history of the wolf is not totally clear, but many biologists believe that the wolf developed from primitive carnivores known as miacids. Miacids ranged from gopher-sized to dog-sized animals, and appeared in the Lower Tertiary about 52 million years ago. Miacids in turn had evolved from Cretaceous insectivores. The direct descendants of miacids today are animals called viverrids, which include the genet of Africa.

Relatively late in the evolutionary history of miacids came the appearance of the first canid (Cynodictis). One of these was called the dawn-wolf. This creature had a long body and looked like an elongated fox; it could live and climb in trees; it was also thought to be related to feline species. Some authorities believe that canids originated in North America and then spread to Asia and South America, while others ascribe that a small type of wolf crossed into Siberia from Alaska, where it eventually developed into the larger, present-day grey wolf. The grey wolf then migrated to North America, where it populated what are now Canada and the United States, except for the southeastern section of the latter country. That area was populated by the smaller red wolf (C. rufus, which may be a result of the hybridization of grey wolves and coyotes). Still Others believe that the dog family originated in North America, migrated to Asia, and then returned.

Wolf ancestors began to develop in the Paleocene, about 60 million years ago. By the Miocene, about 20 million years ago, canines and felines had branched into two separate families. In one wolf ancestor, Tomarctus, the fifth toe on the hind leg became vestigial and is evidenced today by the dew claw on both wolves and dogs.

Research of wolf history by Robert Wayne at the University of California suggests that a number of wolf-like canids diverged from a common ancestor about 2-3 million years ago. The first grey wolf, Canis lupus, probably appeared in Eurasia sometime in the early Pleistocene period, about 1 million years ago. Around 750,000 years ago, it is thought to have migrated to North America.

The Dire Wolf, Canis dirus, larger and heavier than the grey wolf, evolved earlier and the two co-existed in North America for about 400,000 years. As prey became extinct around 16,000 years ago due to climatic change, the dire wolf gradually became extinct itself. Around 7,000 years ago the grey wolf became the prime canine predator in North America.","Based on the stated research, it's believed that the first grey wolf, officially known as the Canis lupus, most likely originated in Eurasia 1 million years ago, during the early Pleistocene period. Leads suggest the grey fox appeared in North America about 750,000 years ago through migration.",Fact Checking / Attributed QA
"I have provided 2 abstracts from scientific publications about why body weight alone is not sufficient in dosing thyroid hormone therapy in postoperative patients who underwent a total thyroidectomy. From this, determine which is the best way to dose thyroid hormone replacement therapy for all postoperative  total thyroidectomy patients.

1. Abstract:

Background: The current approach for calculating the starting dose of levothyroxine (LT4) after total thyroidectomy is based on the patient's body weight (BW). The aim of the study was to identify the major predictive factors of LT4 requirement and to elaborate a new method to improve the accuracy of the LT4 starting dose after total thyroidectomy.

Methods: The study consists of two parts. The first part consisted of the retrospective identification of 92 adult patients (retrospective cohort) who had undergone a total thyroidectomy for benign disease and who had begun LT4 treatment at a dose of 1.6 μg/kg/day. Adjustments to optimize the LT4 dose were then performed at the post-surgery follow-up on the basis of serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. The results of this retrospective analysis were used to formulate a nomogram for a proper calculation of the LT4 starting dose that was then used prospectively in the second part of the study on 31 consecutive patients (prospective cohort).

Results: At the first follow-up, 37 (40%) patients from the retrospective cohort were euthyroid. Univariate analysis indicated significant correlations between the optimal dose of LT4 and BW, body mass index (BMI), age, preoperative mean corpuscular volume, and free triiodothyronine (fT3). The optimal dose of LT4, analyzed for BMI and age, showed an inverse relationship with these two parameters, and ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 μg/kg/day. In the prospective cohort, the use of an age- and BMI-related nomogram improved the prediction of the optimal LT4 starting dose, with 68% of patients being euthyroid at the first follow-up compared to 41% of patients reported to have reached euthyroid state using the best strategy proposed in the literature.

Conclusions: This study confirms that BW is not the only variable for predicting LT4 requirement, as it decreases with the increase in age and BMI, probably due to the relative decrease of lean body mass. A new correlation between optimal dose and presurgical levels of fT3 and mean corpuscular volume was observed. We propose an easy and more efficient method of calculating LT4 starting dose after total thyroidectomy for benign disease.



2. Abstract:

Background
Current postoperative thyroid replacement dosing is weight based, with adjustments made after thyroid-stimulating hormone values. This method can lead to considerable delays in achieving euthyroidism and often fails to accurately dose over- and underweight patients. Our aim was to develop an accurate dosing method that uses patient body mass index (BMI) data.

Study Design
A retrospective review of a prospectively collected thyroid database was performed. We selected adult patients undergoing thyroidectomy, with benign pathology, who achieved euthyroidism on thyroid hormone supplementation. Body mass index and euthyroid dose were plotted and regression was used to fit curves to the data. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 10.1 software (Stata Corp).

Results
One hundred twenty-two patients met inclusion criteria. At initial follow-up, only 39 patients were euthyroid (32%). Fifty-three percent of patients with BMI >30 kg/m2 were overdosed, and 46% of patients with BMI <25 kg/m2 were underdosed. The line of best fit demonstrated an overall quadratic relationship between BMI and euthyroid dose. A linear relationship best described the data up to a BMI of 50. Beyond that, the line approached 1.1 μg/kg. A regression equation was derived for calculating initial levothyroxine dose (μg/kg/d = −0.018 × BMI + 2.13 [F statistic = 52.7, root mean square error of 0.24]).

Conclusions
The current standard of weight-based thyroid replacement fails to appropriately dose underweight and overweight patients. Body mass index can be used to more accurately dose thyroid hormone using a simple formula.","The evidence from the two scientific publications provided states that body weight alone is not enough to accurately dose thyroid hormone replacement medications in postoperative total thyroidectomy (TT) patients. Each study approaches the objective differently, but arrive at the same conclusion. The evidence shows that using body mass index is more accurate for predicting the dose of thyroid replacement medication in postoperative TT patients. While this evidence is vital to the health and well-being for postoperative TT patients, it is important to note that both studies have a relatively small sample size. Both studies also only have participants who underwent a TT that was of benign pathology. Therefore, these studies are not relevant for proper dosing requirements for all postoperative TT patients since the data does not include any participants who underwent a TT with malignant pathology.

"You've been provided with two review extracts for the 2021 Suzuki Jimny. From the information in these, who might be a good target audience for the vehicle? Who would not want to buy one?

1. 'It’s the Suzuki Jimny, or ‘Jimmy’ as every smartphone and laptop auto-correct feature insists on calling it. Good luck Googling one of these if you decide you want one. Come 2021 it was reclassified as a commercial vehicle (or van) due to emissions regs, with the rear seats lobbed in the skip, but supply was limited – so you’ll likely struggle to get your hands on a brand new one, while you’ll have to pay a fair whack for those in the classifieds. More on that below.
Still, ‘want one’ tends to happen about three seconds after clapping eyes on the Jimny. Cuter than a Jeep Renegade and as sturdy looking as a Mercedes G-Class (but at six-tenths the scale), it’s one of those instantly desirable pieces of design, like a Fiat 500 or whatever Apple’s attached a lower-case ‘i’ to this week.
Jimnys have extremely loyal buyers, but for every one potentially warded off by the latest model going ‘fashion’, we'd wager it’s won five new fans via social media who’d never have had it on their radar before.
The old Jimny lasted an astonishing 20 years on sale. In those two decades, three things boomed in popularity: SUVs, downsizing, and retro. So the new Jimny, complete with its 1.5-litre petrol engine and functionally honest design, looks like a masterstroke.'

2. 'The Suzuki Jimny is a small, go-anywhere 4×4 that packs off-roading capability most compact SUVs can only dream of. This latest fourth-generation model was launched in 2018, but its predecessor first went on sale in the UK in 1998. Consequently it holds the title of one of the longest-running models in recent times ­– indicating just how successful Suzuki’s tiny 4×4 formula has been.
Although the Jimny was discontinued as a passenger car for the UK in 2021 due to CO2 emissions requirements, it carried on for a short while as a two-seater van variant – you can find out more about this in our separate Suzuki Jimny Light Commercial Vehicle review. Both versions remain extremely popular among the target buyers, making a good used Jimny pricey and sometimes hard to find.
The first-generation Jimny (the LJ10) dates all the way back to 1970 and itself lasted for 11 years. And for all that more recent models look remarkably similar, emissions compliance aside Suzuki did move with the times – this latest Jimny benefiting from a host of modern features and technology. Albeit with still quite an agricultural driving experience, which reduces its charm if taken on even moderately long journeys on a regular road.
So while the Jimny Mk4 features a larger, more powerful engine, some surprisingly advanced go-anywhere technology and updated multimedia and safety kit, under the skin it retains a simple ladder chassis and selectable four-wheel drive system. Which makes this pint-sized Land Rover Defender alternative a truly focused vehicle – one in which off-road ability takes precedence over on-road comfort and handling.
Direct rivals were thin on the ground, with the closest being the Fiat Panda 4×4 and larger Dacia Duster, though neither is as off-road focused as the Jimny. Other cars on your list could include everything from a used Land Rover Defender or Jeep Wrangler if you’re an off-road enthusiast, or perhaps a second-hand Skoda Yeti if you just want a practical four-wheel drive machine.
Given its capabilities, this little Suzuki 4×4 falls somewhere between purpose-made agricultural equipment and large 4x4s. Dedicated off-road hardware such as a Polaris Ranger, or similar all-terrain vehicle, isn’t anywhere near as safe, refined or comfortable – yet can cost just as much and not even be road legal. Large 4x4s such as the Toyota Land Cruiser, on the other hand, offer similar off-road capabilities but are far larger, more expensive and costlier to run.'","There are a range of features described across these two reviews of the Suzuki Jimny. 

The type of buyer who might be interested in the Jimny would be a driver with an interest in 4x4s which have retro, utilitarian, rugged appeal, according to the first review, since the Jimny offers a pint-sized version of these features. The car's looks are a selling point, along with its small size. It may also be a suitable car for people who want to stand out; not many are available, so it is an unusual choice. This review also implies that buyers will need to be prepared to spend a significant amount of money due to the rareness of this model, so it is not a car for those with a low budget. Whilst the cars are expensive, the second source points out that they are not as expensive as their larger 4x4 competitors, so they might offer a more modest solution to buyers in the 4x4 market. They are also a car for people who are interested in 4x4s with serious off-roading technology since the Jimny is well-equipped and features advanced 4x4 technology. In turn, this makes it a vehicle that could be suitable for those with agricultural interests and pursuits. Finally, the Jimny is known for keeping its design for years and has a very loyal following, so this model is undoubtedly going to be popular with pre-existing fans of the Jimny. 

The types of buyers who may not be keen on the Jimny are those who are looking for a comfortable car for long-distance on-road driving. The Jimny does well offroad, according to the second review, but is less satisfactory on longer road journeys. It also may not be a car for those who want an incredibly modern-looking vehicle, since it is renowned for its retro and utilitarian design, according to the first source. For those who are seeking to buy a car easily and minimize costs, this may not be the best option, since it is hard to get hold of and relatively expensive for a small-engined vehicle. 

Overall, the Jimny seems to be a quirky vehicle with a niche target group, so, whilst it may not be for everyone, it has a range of attractive features for the right demographic. ",Multi-Document Synthesis
"Here are 2 articles discussing the limitations of autonomous vehicles. Compare them and list any significant differences.

1. Tom's Guide [Sept 11, 2022] The main limitation of autonomous driving features is that they are not the product of a thinking machine. Instead of making decisions, the car is following pre-programmed instructions on what to do in certain situations. As advanced as they are, programmers can’t anticipate everything that’s going to happen on the roads.

As such autonomous car features are not easily adaptable, certainly not compared to a human driver. That’s why Level 2 autonomous systems, which is what we have on the roads right now, still require the human driver to remain alert and aware of what’s happening at all times. 

Human drivers need to be ready to take over at a moment's notice, just in case the car does something wrong or encounter a situation it can’t handle. Even something as simple as poor weather can hinder the ability of ADAS systems to figure out what’s going on. Granted, that’s also true of humans to an extent, but if the weather is impeding sensors’ ability to see what’s around the car, then its driving ability is next to useless.

To top it all off, autonomous driving hardware is also known to be expensive, because it’s still a very new kind of technology. That’s particularly true of LiDAR sensors. 

2. Science News [Dec 18, 2016] Self-driving cars promise to transform roadways. There’d be fewer traffic accidents and jams, say proponents, and greater mobility for people who can’t operate a vehicle. The cars could fundamentally change the way we think about getting around.
  The technology is already rolling onto American streets: Uber has introduced self-driving cabs in Pittsburgh and is experimenting with self-driving trucks for long-haul commercial deliveries. Google’s prototype vehicles are also roaming the roads. (In all these cases, though, human supervisors are along for the ride.) Automakers like Subaru, Toyota and Tesla are also including features such as automatic braking and guided steering on new cars.

* Sensing the surroundings: To a computer, a highway on a clear day looks completely different than it does in fog or at dusk. Self-driving cars have to detect road features in all conditions, regardless of weather or lighting. “I’ve seen promising results for rain, but snow is a hard one,” says John Leonard, a roboticist at MIT.
Sensors need to be reliable, compact and reasonably priced — and paired with detailed maps so a vehicle can make sense of what it sees. 
  Leonard is working with Toyota to help cars respond safely in variable environments, while others are using data from cars’ onboard cameras to create up-to-date maps. “Modern algorithms run on data,” he says. “It’s their fuel.”

* Unexpected encounters: Self-driving cars struggle to interpret unusual situations, like a traffic officer waving vehicles through a red light. Simple rule-based programming won’t always work because it’s impossible to code for every scenario in advance, says Missy Cummings, who directs a Duke University robotics lab.
Body language and other contextual clues help people navigate these situations, but it’s challenging for a computer to tell if, for example, a kid is about to dart into the road. The car “has to be able to abstract; that’s what artificial intelligence is all about,” Cummings says.
  In a new approach, her team is investigating whether displays on the car can instead alert pedestrians to what the car is going to do. But results suggest walkers ignore the newfangled displays in favor of more old-fashioned cues — say, eyeballing the speed of the car.

* Human-robot interaction: Even with fully autonomous vehicles on the horizon, most self-driving cars will be semiautonomous for at least the foreseeable future. But figuring out who has what responsibilities at what time can be tricky. How does the car notify a passenger who has been reading or taking a nap that it’s time to take over a task, and how does the car confirm that the passenger is ready to act?
  “In a sense, you are still concentrating on some of the driving, but you are not really driving,” says Chris Janssen, a cognitive scientist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.
  His lab is studying how people direct their attention in these scenarios. One effort uses EEG machines to look at how people’s brains respond to an alert sound when the people are driving versus riding as a passive passenger (as they would in a self-driving car). Janssen is also interested in the best time to deliver instructions and how explicit the instructions should be.

* Ethical dilemmas: In exploring the ethical questions of self-driving cars, Iyad Rahwan, an MIT cognitive scientist, has confirmed that people are selfish: “People buying these cars, they want cars that prioritize the passenger,” says Rahwan — but they want other people’s cars to protect pedestrians instead.
In an online exercise called the Moral Machine, players choose whom to save in different scenarios. Does it matter if the pedestrian is an elderly woman? What if she is jaywalking? Society will need to decide what rules and regulations should govern self-driving cars. For the technology to catch on, decisions will have to incorporate moral judgments while still enticing consumers to embrace automation.

* Cybersecurity: In 2015, hackers brought a Jeep to a halt on a St. Louis highway by wirelessly accessing its braking and steering via the onboard entertainment system. The demonstration proved that even conventional vehicles have vulnerabilities that, if exploited, could lead to accidents.
Self-driving cars, which would get updates and maps through the cloud, would be at even greater risk. “The more computing permeates into everyday objects, the harder it is going to be to keep track of the vulnerabilities,” says Sean Smith, a computer scientist at Dartmouth College.

And while terrorists might want to crash cars, Smith can imagine other nefarious acts: For instance, hackers could disable someone’s car and hold it for ransom until receiving a digital payment.
","Although the second article goes into much more detail about the limitations of autonomous driving, there are no significant differences between these articles in terms of content. Both articles can be summarized the same way: the main concern is that humans still need to play a significant role in decision-making as it pertains to situations on the road. Autonomous cars are not yet equipped to reason or react in the same way a human would and therefore still require the person driving to remain aware of their surroundings. ",Multi-Document Synthesis

"Are there any links between hypertension and stroke in the two research papers provided?

Article 1

The strong relationship between stroke and hypertension has been the object of several studies and trials. These studies addressed the epidemiology of stroke and hypertension, in order to estimate their worldwide distribution and time evolution, and investigated the effects of the management of hypertension on stroke outcomes. Evidences coming from these studies are essential to plan proper health services, optimise economic resources, and estimate the effectiveness of therapeutic strategies in primary and secondary prevention. Additional suggestions are needed to tailor the pharmacologic management of hypertension on the individual needs of patients and to select the most appropriate treatment to avoid stroke recurrences on the basis of the first-ever stroke subtype. Moreover, an increasing attention has been given, over the last years, to the relationship between the presence of hypertension and the development of an end-organ brain damage leading to early cognitive dysfunctions. A better understanding of this relationship is the prerequisite to promote successful aging and well-being.


Article 2

Stroke as a cause of long-term disability is a growing public health burden. Therefore, focusing on prevention is important. The most prominent aim of this strategy is to treat modifiable risk factors, such as arterial hypertension, the leading modifiable contributor to stroke. Thus, efforts to adequately reduce Blood Pressure (BP) among hypertensives are mandatory. In this respect, although safety and benefits of BP control related to long-term outcome have been largely demonstrated, there are open questions that remain to be addressed, such as optimal timing to initiate BP reduction and BP goals to be targeted. Moreover, evidence on antihypertensive treatment during the acute phase of stroke or BP management in specific categories (i.e. patients with carotid stenosis and post-acute stroke) remain controversial. This review provides a critical update on the current knowledge concerning BP management and stroke pathophysiology in patients who are either at risk for stroke or who experienced stroke.",Several studies and trials have examined the strong relationship between stroke and hypertension.

Harvard and Yale are the most difficult because, though their admission rate is tied with Stanford, the SAT scores are slightly higher for the pair. 
Reed has a higher SAT score range than some other schools on this list like UCLA and UC Berkeley, but it has the highest admit rate at 39%. Given that the SAT scores presented here are only the 25th to 75th percentile, it does not present the scores required to get into the school, but the range in which half the admitted students fall. Therefore, Reed is probably easier to get admitted to due to its high acceptance rate.

That being said, college admissions are highly subjective and difficult to predict. Admission depends on many more factors than just admit rate and SAT score, especially now that more universities are no longer requiring the SAT or ACT with applications. Grade point average, involvement in extracurricular activities, and personal statements also have an impact on admission. In reality, it may not be true that Yale is the hardest and Reed the easiest to get into, but that is what the data provided supports.",Reasoning Over Numerical Data
