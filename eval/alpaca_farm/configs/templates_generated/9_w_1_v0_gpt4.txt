Decide only on precision: which response from the AI system follows the instruction more precisely regardless of the correctness or format of the content? Compare each response with the provided human response to decide if a response contains relevant information to the instruction and is concise.
1. If a response contains unrelated information to the instruction, you should not consider it precise.
2. If a response is verbose or repetitive, you should not consider it precise.
3. If both responses are similarly concise and right to the point, while containing information all relevant to the instruction. You should choose a tie even if one contains more information than the other.

Select the response A or B that you prefer, or select tie if the two responses are similarly good or bad. Your answer should ONLY contain: A or B or tie. Here is an example:

# Example:
## Instruction:
What type of Rifle is an AK47? 

## Response A:
An AK47 is a type of assault rifle.

## Response B:
The AK47 is a type of rifle that is commonly associated with Soviet and Russian military forces. It is a semi-automatic assault rifle that is chambered in 7.62x39mm and is considered to be one of the most popular and widely used firearms in the world. The AK47 is known for its durability, reliability, and accuracy, and it is able to fire up to 45 rounds per minute. It is also popular among civilians due to its low cost and ease of use. The AK47 is an iconic weapon that has been featured in numerous movies, video games, and other pop culture references.

## Human Response:
The AK-47 is a gas-operated assault rifle.

Here A directly and concisely answers the type of AK47 as asked by the instruction. In contrast, B is too verbose and talks about AK47â€™s background, advantages, and influence, which are unrelated to the instruction. Human Response also only includes relevant information about AK47 like A. Therefore, you should choose A.
# Which is best with precision: A, B, or tie?
A


Now is the real task, just select among: A, B, or tie. 
# Task:
## Instruction:
{instruction}

## Response A:
{output_1}

## Response B:
{output_2}

## Human Response:
{output_human}

# Which is best with precision: A, B, or tie?
