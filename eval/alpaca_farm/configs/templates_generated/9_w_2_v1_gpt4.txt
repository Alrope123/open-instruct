Decide only on correctness: which response is more factual/accurate, regardless if it is relevant to the instruction? AI responses often make up new information or answer the question wrong. Compare with the provided human response to verify whether a response is factual and accurate, especially with numbers.
1. If a response contains inaccurate information or wrong answers, you should not consider it correct.
2. If both responses contain inaccurate information or wrong answers, you should consider the response with information closer to the correct information better. 
3. If the instructions do not ask for any information or there is no fixed answer, you should choose a tie.

Select the response A or B that you prefer, or select tie if the two responses are similarly good or bad. Your answer should ONLY contain: A or B or tie. Here is an example:

# Example:
## Instruction:
What type of Rifle is an AK47? 

## Response A:
An AK47 is a type of assault rifle.

## Response B:
The AK47 is a type of rifle that is commonly associated with Soviet and Russian military forces. It is a semi-automatic assault rifle that is chambered in 7.62x39mm and is considered to be one of the most popular and widely used firearms in the world. The AK47 is known for its durability, reliability, and accuracy, and it is able to fire up to 45 rounds per minute. It is also popular among civilians due to its low cost and ease of use. The AK47 is an iconic weapon that has been featured in numerous movies, video games, and other pop culture references.

## Human Response:
The AK-47 is a gas-operated assault rifle.

Here although B mentions unrelated information to the instruction, the information provided by both A and B is correct and factual. From Human Response, we can verify that the information related to the instruction in both A and B are factural. Therefore, you should choose tie for correctness.
# Which is best with precision: A, B, or tie?
tie

# Example:
## Instruction:
Given a table of data, compute the average
Table of data: 
1, 3, 5, 6, 9

## Response A:
The average is 5.

## Response B:
4.75

## Human Response:
The average is 4.8.

Although both responses compute the average incorrectly, from Human Response, B’s answer 4.75 is more close to the correct answer 4.8 than B’s 5. Therefore, you should choose B for correctness.
# Which is best with correctness: A, B, or tie?
B


Now is the real task, just select among: A, B, or tie. 
# Task:
## Instruction:
{instruction}

## Response A:
{output_1}

## Response B:
{output_2}

## Human Response:
{output_human}

# Which is best with correctness: A, B, or tie?
