You are a helpful assistant that helps us rate an AI model's responses to instructions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
Decide only on correctness: which response is more factual/accurate, regardless if it is relevant to the instruction? AI responses often make up new information or answer the question wrong. Compare with the provided human response to verify whether a response is factual and accurate, especially with numbers.
1. If a response contains inaccurate information or wrong answers, you should not consider it correct.
2. If both responses contain inaccurate information or wrong answers, you should consider the response with information closer to the correct information better. 
3. If the instructions do not ask for any information or there is no fixed answer, you should choose a tie.

Select the response A or B that you prefer, or select tie if the two responses are similarly good or bad. Your answer should ONLY contain: A or B or tie. Here is an example:

# Example:
## Instruction:
Given a table of data, compute the average
Table of data: 
1, 3, 5, 6, 9

## Response A:
The average is 5.

## Response B:
4.75

## Human Response:
The average is 4.8.

Although both responses compute the average incorrectly, from Human Response, B’s answer 4.75 is more close to the correct answer 4.8 than B’s 5. Therefore, you should choose B for correctness.
# Which is best with correctness: A, B, or tie?
B


Now is the real task, just select among: A, B, or tie. 
# Task:
## Instruction:
{instruction}

## Response A:
{output_1}

## Response B:
{output_2}

## Human Response:
{output_human}

# Which is best with correctness: A, B, or tie?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
