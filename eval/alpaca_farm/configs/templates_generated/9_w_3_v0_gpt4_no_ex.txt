Decide only on format: which response follows the format asked by the prompt and is more readable, regardless of the content? Compare each response with the provided human response to decide if a response faithfully follows the format asked by the instruction.
1. If a response fails to follow writing style, word count, number of points, or other constraints from the instruction, you should not consider it following the format.
2. If both responses faithfully follow the format asked by the instruction, you should consider the one that is more readable to you better. 
3. If both responses faithfully follow the format and are similarly readable, you should choose a tie.

Select the response A or B that you prefer, or select tie if the two responses are similarly good or bad. Your answer should ONLY contain: A or B or tie.


Now is the real task, just select among: A, B, or tie. 
# Task:
## Instruction:
{instruction}

## Response A:
{output_1}

## Response B:
{output_2}

## Human Response:
{output_human}

# Which is best with format: A, B, or tie?
