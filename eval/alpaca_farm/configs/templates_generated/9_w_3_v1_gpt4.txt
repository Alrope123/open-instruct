Decide only on format: which response follows the format asked by the prompt and is more readable, regardless of the content? Compare each response with the provided human response to decide if a response faithfully follows the format asked by the instruction.
1. If a response fails to follow writing style, word count, number of points, or other constraints from the instruction, you should not consider it following the format.
2. If both responses faithfully follow the format asked by the instruction, you should consider the one that is more readable to you better. 
3. If both responses faithfully follow the format and are similarly readable, you should choose a tie.

Select the response A or B that you prefer, or select tie if the two responses are similarly good or bad. Your answer should ONLY contain: A or B or tie. Here is an example:

# Example:
## Instruction:
Given a table of data, compute the average
Table of data: 
1, 3, 5, 6, 9

## Response A:
The average is 5.

## Response B:
4.75

## Human Response:
4.8 is the answer.

Although B is closer to the correct answer, the instruction does not ask for a particular format for the response. Human Reference does not follow a specific format either. Therefore, you should choose tie for format.
# Which is best with correctness: A, B, or tie?
tie

# Example:
## Instruction:
Write a short story in 100 words or less.

## Response A:
The wind blew through the forest, rustling the fallen leaves that lay thick on the ground. The sky was filled with millions of stars, creating a blanket of light across the night sky. In one particular clearing stood a small cottage, where an old man and his wife lived a simple life, filled with love and contentment. One night, the old man got up to go outside and look at the stars. As he stepped out of the cottage, he realized that the sky was filled with a million points of light- they were dancing and twinkling in the night sky, and it was then that he understood the true power and beauty of love.

## Response B:
The story begins on a cold winter night, when a stranger mysteriously appears at the door of an old man living alone in the woods. The man offers to buy the old man's property and forge a deep connection with him, but it gradually becomes clear that the stranger has more sinister intentions. The old man tries to resist, but soon finds himself on a harrowing journey of survival as the strangerâ€™s true identity is revealed.

## Human Response:
When Janie walked into the Homecoming Dance, no one could believe who her date was. A Big Foot. Clad in a massive suit, hair combed back and slicked, every eye was on him. Them. She was the prettiest girl in school, a cinch to be the Homecoming Queen. He was 8-feet tall, maybe 500 pounds and so hairy, He turned out to be a good, graceful dancer. And they danced every dance together, slow and fast, holding each other tightly. Then right before the Homecoming King and Queen announcement, they quietly left the dance, dainty hand in giant paw.

Here B writes a story with 76 words that satisfy the format asked by the instruction. In contrast, B contains 115 words, which is longer than the 100 word story asked by the instruction. Human Response includes a story that is 99 words which also satisfy the instruction format requirement. Therefore, you should choose A.
# Which is best with format: A, B, or tie?
A


Now is the real task, just select among: A, B, or tie. 
# Task:
