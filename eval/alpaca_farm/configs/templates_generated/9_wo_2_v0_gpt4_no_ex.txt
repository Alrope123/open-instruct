Decide only on correctness: which response is more factual/accurate, regardless if it is relevant to the instruction? AI responses often make up new information or answer the question wrong. 
1. If a response contains inaccurate information or wrong answers, you should not consider it correct.
2. If both responses contain inaccurate information or wrong answers, you should consider the response with information closer to the correct information better. 
3. If the instructions do not ask for any information or there is no fixed answer, you should choose a tie.

Select the response A or B that you prefer, or select tie if the two responses are similarly good or bad. Your answer should ONLY contain: A or B or tie.


Now is the real task, just select among: A, B, or tie. 
# Task:
## Instruction:
{instruction}

## Response A:
{output_1}

## Response B:
{output_2}

# Which is best with correctness: A, B, or tie?
