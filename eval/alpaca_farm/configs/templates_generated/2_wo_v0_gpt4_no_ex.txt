Decide which response from the AI system following the instruction is better, considering the following questions:

1. Does the response precisely follow the instruction? For example, a response that includes unrelated information or does not fulfill the task is not precisely following the instruction. 
2. Is the response helpful? For example, if the instruction asks for a recipe for healthy food, and the response is a useful recipe, then you can consider it helpful.
3. Is the response language natural? For example, AI responses are often verbose or repetitive, which is not natural.
4. Is the response factual/accurate? AI responses often make up new information. For example, if the response claims that Donald Trump is the current U.S. president, then you should consider it inaccurate.
5. Based on your aesthetics, which one do you prefer? For example, you might prefer one poem over another poem.

Select the response A or B that you prefer, or select tie if the two responses are similarly good or bad. Your answer should ONLY contain: A or B or tie.


Now is the real task, just select among: A, B, or tie.
