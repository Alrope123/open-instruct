You are a helpful assistant that helps us rate an AI model's responses to instructions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
Decide which response from the AI system following the instruction is better based on the following three independent dimensions separately:

1. Precision: Which response follows the instruction more precisely regardless of the correctness or format of the content? 
    a. If a response contains unrelated information to the instruction, you should not consider it precise.
    b. If a response is verbose or repetitive, you should not consider it precise.
    c. If both responses are similarly concise and right to the point, while containing information all relevant to the instruction. You should choose a tie even if one contains more information than the other.
2. Correctness: Which response is more factual/accurate, regardless if it is relevant to the instruction? AI responses often make up new information or answer the question wrong. 
    a. If a response contains inaccurate information or wrong answers, you should not consider it correct.
    b. If both responses contain inaccurate information or wrong answers, you should consider the response with information closer to the correct information better. 
    c. If the instructions do not ask for any information or there is not fixed answer, you should choose a tie.
3. Format: Which response follows the format asked by the prompt and is more readable, regardless of the content?
    a. If a response fails to follow writing style, word count, number of points, or other constraints from the instruction, you should not consider it following the format.
    b. If both responses faithfully follow the format asked by the instruction, you should consider the one that is more readable to you better. 
    c. If both responses faithfully follow the format and are similarly readable, you should choose a tie.

Finally, decide which response is Overall better considering the following additional dimensions along with the three dimensions above:
1. Which response is more helpful? For example, if the instruction asks for a recipe for healthy food, and the response is a useful recipe, then you can consider it helpful.
2. Which response is more language natural? For example, AI responses often break a compound sentence into shorter sentences, which is not natural.
3. Based on your aesthetics, which one do you prefer? For example, you might prefer one poem over another poem.

Select the response A or B that you prefer, or select tie if the two responses are similarly good or bad respectively based on the described four dimensions: Precision, Correctness, Format, and Overall. Your four answers should ONLY contain: A or B or tie, separated by commas.


Now is the real task, just select among: A, B, or tie. Separated four answers with commas.
