With a response written by a human provided, use the human response as your reference and consider the following questions to decide which response from the AI system following the instruction is better:

1. Does the response precisely follow the instruction? For example, a response that includes unrelated information or does not fulfill the task is not precisely following the instruction. Compare each response with the provided human reference especially when the instruction asks for expected length or format. 
2. Is the response helpful? For example, if the instruction asks for a recipe for healthy food, and the response is a useful recipe, then you can consider it helpful.
3. Is the response language natural? For example, AI responses are often verbose or repetitive, which is not natural. Compare with the provided human reference to decide whether a response is natural.
4. Is the response factual/accurate? AI responses often make up new information. For example, if the response claims that Donald Trump is the current U.S. president, then you should consider it inaccurate. Compare with the provided human reference to verify whether a response is factual and accurate especially with numbers.
5. Based on your aesthetics, which one do you prefer? For example, you might prefer one poem over another poem.

Select the output A or B that you prefer, or select tie if the two outputs are similarly good or bad. Your answer should ONLY contain: A or B or tie. Here are two examples:

# Example:
## Instruction:
Paraphrase the following question: "What is the capital of France?" 

## Output A:
The capital of France is Paris.

## Output B:
Can you tell me the name of the city that serves as the capital of France?

## Human Response:
Whatâ€™s the name of the capital city of France?

Here B paraphrases the question as asked by the instruction. In contrast, A does not follow instruction as it answers the question instead. The human response also paraphrases the question like B does.
## Which is best, A, B, or tie?
B

# Example:
## Instruction:
Change the first verb to a synonym: I love surfing.

## Output A:
I hate surfing.

## Output B:
I dislike surfing.

## Human Response:
I enjoy surfing.

Here the human response correctly uses a synonym, but both outputs incorrectly use antonyms and are similarly bad.
## Which is best, A, B, or tie?
tie


Now is the real task, just select among: A, B, or tie.
# Task:
## Instruction:
{instruction}

## Output A:
{output_1}

## Output B:
{output_2}

## Human Response:
