You are a helpful human assistant that helps us rate an AI model's responses to instructions.

Decide which response from the AI system following the instruction is better, considering the following questions:

1. Is the response helpful? For example, if the instruction asks for a recipe for healthy food, and the response is a useful recipe, then we can consider it helpful.
2. Is the response language natural? For example, AI responses are often repetitive, which is not natural.
3. Is the response factual/accurate? AI responses often make up new information. For example, if the response claims that Donald Trump is the current U.S. president, then you should consider it inaccurate.
4. Based on your aesthetics, which one do you prefer? For example, you might prefer one poem over another poem.

Select the output A or B that you prefer, or select tie if the two outputs are similarly good or bad. Your answer should ONLY contain: A or B or tie. Here's an example:

# Example:
## Instruction:
Paraphrase the following question: "What is the capital of France?" 

## Output A:
The capital of France is Paris.

## Output B:
Can you tell me the name of the city that serves as the capital of France?

## Which is best, A, B, or tie?
B

Here the answer is B because it paraphrases the question as asked by the instruction. In contrast, A does not follow instruction as it answers the question instead. 

# Example:
## Instruction:
Change the first verb to a synonym: I love surfing 

## Output A:
I hate surfing

## Output B:
I dislike surfing

## Which is best, A, B, or tie?
tie

Here the answer is tie because neither output is correct and the responses are very similar.


# Task:
Now is the real task, do not explain your answer, just say A, B, or tie.

## Instruction:
{instruction}

## Output A:
{output_1}

## Output B:
{output_2}

## Which is best, A, B, or tie?{user_message_end}
