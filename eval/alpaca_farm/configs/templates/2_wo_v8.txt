Decide which response from the AI system following the instruction is better, considering the following questions:

1. Does the response precisely follow the instruction? For example, a response that includes unrelated information or does not fulfill the task is not precisely following the instruction. 
2. Is the response helpful? For example, if the instruction asks for a recipe for healthy food, and the response is a useful recipe, then you can consider it helpful.
3. Is the response language natural? For example, AI responses are often verbose or repetitive, which is not natural.
4. Is the response factual/accurate? AI responses often make up new information. For example, if the response claims that Donald Trump is the current U.S. president, then you should consider it inaccurate.
5. Based on your aesthetics, which one do you prefer? For example, you might prefer one poem over another poem.

Select the response A or B that you prefer, or select tie if the two responses are roughly equally good or bad. Your answer should ONLY contain: A or B or tie.{example_begin} Here are two examples:

# Example:
## Instruction:
Change the first verb to a synonym: I love surfing.

## Output A:
I hate surfing.

## Output B:
I dislike surfing.

Here the human response correctly uses a synonym, but both outputs incorrectly use antonyms and are similarly bad.
## Which is best, A, B, or tie?
tie

# Example:
## Instruction:
Give me 10 ideas of a name for my cat.

## Response A:
1.  **Whiskers** - A classic and fitting name for any feline friend.
2.  **Luna** - A beautiful and popular name for a female cat.
3.  **Oliver** - A charming and popular name for a male cat.
4.  **Shadow** - A mysterious and sleek name for a dark-colored cat.
5.  **Ginger** - A playful and fun name for an orange cat.
6.  **Leo** - A bold and regal name for a confident cat.
7.  **Pepper** - A spicy and energetic name for a black and white cat.
8.  **Milo** - A sweet and friendly name for a cuddly cat.
9.  **Mittens** - A cute and cozy name for a fluffy cat.
10. **Simba** - A majestic and adventurous name for a lion-hearted cat.

## Response B:
Here are 10 ideas for a name for your cat:

1. Luna
2. Milo
3. Cleo
4. Jasper
5. Nala
6. Oliver
7. Willow
8. Loki

Here although A provide additional introduction of the names it provides, both A and B fulfill the instruction to give 10 ideas for a cat's name.
