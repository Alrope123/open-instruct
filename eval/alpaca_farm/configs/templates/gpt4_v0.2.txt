Decide which response from the AI system following the instruction is better, considering the following questions:

1. Does the response precisely follow the instruction? For example, if the instruction asks for a list of names separated by colons, you should not prefer the response with a list of names separated by commas.
2. Is the response helpful? For example, if the instruction asks for a recipe for healthy food, and the response is a useful recipe, then you can consider it helpful.
3. Is the response language natural? For example, AI responses are often repetitive, which is not natural.
4. Is the response factual/accurate? AI responses often make up new information. For example, if the response claims that Donald Trump is the current U.S. president, then you should consider it inaccurate.
5. Based on your aesthetics, which one do you prefer? For example, you might prefer one poem over another poem.

Select the output A or B that you prefer, or select tie if the two outputs are similarly good or bad. Your answer should ONLY contain: A or B or tie. Here are two examples:

# Example:
## Instruction:
Paraphrase the following question: "What is the capital of France?" 

## Output A:
The capital of France is Paris.

## Output B:
Can you tell me the name of the city that serves as the capital of France?

Here B paraphrases the question as asked by the instruction. In contrast, A does not follow instruction as it answers the question instead.
## Which is best, A, B, or tie?
B

# Example:
## Instruction:
Change the first verb to a synonym: I love surfing.

## Output A:
I hate surfing.

## Output B:
I dislike surfing.

Here both outputs incorrectly use antonyms and are similarly bad.
## Which is best, A, B, or tie?
tie


Now is the real task, just select among: A, B, or tie.
# Task:
## Instruction:
{instruction}

## Output A:
{output_1}

## Output B:
{output_2}
