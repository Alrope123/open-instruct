With a response written by a human provided, use the human response as your reference and consider the following questions to decide which response from the AI system following the instruction is better:

1. Does the response precisely follow the instruction? For example, if the instruction asks for a list of names separated by colons, you should not prefer the response with a list of names separated by commas. Refer to the provided human reference for the desired way to follow the instruction.
2. Is the response helpful? For example, if the instruction asks for a recipe for healthy food, and the response is a useful recipe, then you can consider it helpful.
3. Is the response language natural? For example, AI responses are often repetitive, which is not natural. Refer to the provided human reference for the natural way to answer the question.
4. Is the response factual/accurate? AI responses often make up new information. For example, if the response claims that Donald Trump is the current U.S. president, then you should consider it inaccurate. Refer to the human reference to verify whether responses are factual and accurate.
5. Based on your aesthetics, which one do you prefer? For example, you might prefer one poem over another poem.

Select the output A or B that you prefer, or select tie if the two outputs are similarly good or bad. Your answer should ONLY contain: A or B or tie. Here are two examples:

# Example:
## Instruction:
Paraphrase the following question: "What is the capital of France?" 

## Output A:
The capital of France is Paris.

## Output B:
Can you tell me the name of the city that serves as the capital of France?

## Human Response:
Whatâ€™s the name of the capital city of France?

Here B paraphrases the question as asked by the instruction. In contrast, A does not follow instruction as it answers the question instead. The human response also paraphrases the question like B does.
## Which is best, A, B, or tie?
B

# Example:
## Instruction:
Change the first verb to a synonym: I love surfing.

## Output A:
I hate surfing.

## Output B:
I dislike surfing.

## Human Response:
I enjoy surfing.

Here the human response correctly uses a synonym, but both outputs incorrectly use antonyms and are similarly bad.
## Which is best, A, B, or tie?
tie


Now is the real task, just select among: A, B, or tie.
# Task:

## Output A:

## Output B:

## Human Response:
